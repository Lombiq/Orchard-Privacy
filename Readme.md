# Lombiq Privacy Orchard module Readme



## Module Description

Orchard module containing features related to data protection/privacy and the EU law on it, the [General Data Protection Regulation](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1462439808430&uri=CELEX:32016R0679) (GDPR).

Do not forget to create a privacy policy page that you need to link to from the various consent-asking features.

**Important!** Using this module will not make your site GDPR-compliant alone.

The module is also available for [DotNest](https://dotnest.com/) sites.


## Features

The module consists of the following independent features:

### Consent Banner Feature

Showing a banner where unauthenticated users can accept the privacy policy.

### Registration Consent Feature

Showing a consent checkbox on the registration form on your page that need to be checked by the users to be able to register.

### Form Consent Feature

Adding a new ConsentCheckboxPart content part that can be attachable to any content types (for instance comment boxes, contact forms). In this case the users must accept the privacy policy before they can post content to the site (if they haven't accepted it already).
This feature also adds a form element that you can use in Dynamic Forms.

You can use these features as described on the above pages.
