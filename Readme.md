# Lombiq Privacy Orchard module



## About

Orchard module containing features related to data protection/privacy and the EU law on it, the [General Data Protection Regulation](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1462439808430&uri=CELEX:32016R0679) (GDPR).

Do not forget to create a privacy policy page that you need to link to from the various consent-asking features.

**Important!** Using this module will not make your site GDPR-compliant alone.

The module is also available for [DotNest](https://dotnest.com/) sites.


## Features

The module consists of the following independent features:

### Consent Banner Feature

Shows a banner where unauthenticated users can accept the privacy policy.

### Registration Consent Feature

Shows a privacy consent checkbox on the registration form that needs to be checked by the users to be able to register.

### Form Consent Feature

Adds a new `ConsentCheckboxPart` content part that can be attached to any content type (for instance comment boxes, contact forms). In this case the users must accept the privacy policy before they can post content to the site (if they haven't accepted it already via the banner).

This feature also adds a similar form element that you can use in Dynamic Forms.
